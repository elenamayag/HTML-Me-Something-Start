            <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">At the top of the list I’d have to place Las Vegas. This is a place I’ve been to many times and whether I’ve been about to participate in all of the activities they have there, or not, I’ve ALWAYS had a great time! Las Vegas is a city that never ever sleeps, and I think that aspect is one that I love. Also, another notable aspect of the city to mention is the foodie scene! There is food from all cultures, at all price levels. It would probably be hard to not find any specific food you are craving! However, I cannot fail to mention my favorite part and what really attracts everyone to Sin City, GAMBLING!! Everyone comes to Las Vegas with high hopes of hitting a large jackpot, or at least making money. Some achieve that goal, but there are others on the opposite end of the spectrum that lose all the money they came with, but hey, it’s all for the experience, right? If you’re a sports fan there is also plenty to check out there. Las Vegas now has a football team, the Las Vegas Raiders, an NHL team, Las Vegas Golden Knights, and lastly, a WNBA team, the Las Vegas Aces.

            <h2>Cabo, Mexico</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">Next, I’d have to recommend Cabo, Mexico. Cabo has a large dock to walk around. The dock has many things to check out as you walk through it, from street vendors, selling little things like bracelets, hats, beverages, and handmade knick-knacks. As you walk along the dock you will also see restaurants, stores, and store fronts where you can purchase other activities they provide, from boat tours and parasailing to yacht and jet ski rentals! The next memorable part, for me, is the shopping mall they had there. This mall was so big and they also had many high-end retailers. Last, but certainly not least, is the gorgeous beaches that Cabo has. The sands are white and so soft, and the water is crystal clear and light blue. One of the beach looking beaches I’ve ever been to! With many resorts offering great prices for your trip, if your looking to vacation somewhere hot and beautiful, I would definitely recommend looking at Cabo, Mexico, for your next trip!

            <h2>San Juan, Puerto Rico</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph">Lastly, I’d like to talk about San Juan, Puerto Rico. Which is a captivating destination that seamlessly blends rich history with vibrant modernity, offering visitors a very unique experience. The historic district of Old San Juan boasts colorful Spanish colonial architecture, cobblestone streets, which I found to be very beautiful. The city's dynamic cultural scene unfolds through its diverse museums, art galleries, and lively festivals, celebrating the island's unique heritage. Beyond its historical allure, San Juan is known for its stunning beaches, including Condado Beach, where crystal-clear waters and golden sands where you can either just relax or you could get a little more adventurous and try out one or some of the many water-based activities to try. The city just has a lively atmosphere, with delicious foods to try,  lively music, and warm hospitality, making San Juan an enticing destination for almost everyone!
